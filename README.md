- **getWorldPosition(shape, vertexIndex?)**  
  Returns the world coordinates of the shape’s origin or a specific vertex (after transforms).

## Transformation Methods

EpicCanvas provides transformation methods for model matrix, view matrix, and direct modification of vertex data.

### Model Matrix Transformations  
_Apply transformations through the model matrix for rendering._

- **makeShapeLookAt(shape, eye, center, up)**  
  Sets the model matrix of the shape so that it "looks at" a target position, similar to camera lookAt but for models.

- **translateModelMatrix(shape, [x, y, z])**  
  Applies translation to the model matrix.

- **rotateModelMatrix(shape, angle, [x, y, z])**  
  Applies rotation (angle in radians) around axis `[x, y, z]`.

- **scaleModelMatrix(shape, [x, y, z])**  
  Applies scaling to the model matrix.

- **moveShapeTo(shape, [x, y, z])**  
  Moves the shape’s model matrix so its origin is at `[x, y, z]`.

- **rotateShapeOnItself(shape, angle, [x, y, z])**  
  Rotates the shape around its own origin (local axis).

### View Matrix Transformations  
_Apply transformations through the view matrix for rendering._

- **translateViewMatrix([x, y, z])**  
  Translates the view matrix.

- **rotateViewMatrix(angle, [x, y, z])**  
  Rotates the view matrix (angle in radians, axis as array).

- **scaleViewMatrix([x, y, z])**  
  Scales the view matrix.

### Direct Vertex Modification Methods  
_Modify the underlying vertex data directly (requires reloadBufferData after use)._

- **center(shape)**  
  Centers the shape’s vertices at the origin.

- **scaleToUnitSize(shape)**  
  Scales the shape so its largest dimension is 1.

- **translateX(shape, dx)**  
  Moves vertices in X.

- **translateY(shape, dy)**  
  Moves vertices in Y.

- **translateZ(shape, dz)**  
  Moves vertices in Z.

- **rotateX(shape, angle)**  
  Rotates vertices around X.

- **rotateY(shape, angle)**  
  Rotates vertices around Y.

- **rotateZ(shape, angle)**  
  Rotates vertices around Z.

- **scale(shape, x, y, z)**  
  Scales vertices.

## Dependencies

This library uses [gl-matrix.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gl-matrix/2.8.1/gl-matrix-min.js) for matrix math.

---

## Notes

- All colors, and texture values should be floats between 0.0 and 1.0.
- This library is in early development. API may change.
